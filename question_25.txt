There is a line of code like this in my Java project: 
return jdbcTemplate.query(SOME_SQL_STATEMENT, new Object[][id], new SomeRowMapper());

And I got the following SonarQube issue:
"Remove this use of 'query'; it is deprecated."

Is it enough to just remove query, which makes the line of code look like this?
return jdbcTemplate.(SOME_SQL_STATEMENT, new Object[][id], new SomeRowMapper());
