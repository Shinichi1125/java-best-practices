Great question â€” and this is a **very common refactoring scenario** in Java.

Letâ€™s go step by step ðŸ‘‡

---

### âœ… 1. Look at how `keys` is defined

```java
List keys = new ArrayList(someData.keySet());
```

Youâ€™re creating a `List` that holds the **keys** from a `Map`.
Since `Map.keySet()` returns a `Set<K>` (where `K` is the key type),
your `keys` list should have the **same type as the mapâ€™s key**.

---

### âœ… 2. The best practice is to use generics

If you know what the key type is (e.g., `String`, `Integer`, etc.):

```java
List<String> keys = new ArrayList<>(someData.keySet());
iterateKeys(keys);
```

Then define your method like this:

```java
private void iterateKeys(List<String> keys) {
    for (String key : keys) {
        // do something
    }
}
```

---

### âœ… 3. If you want it to work for any key type (generic method)

You can make the method **generic**:

```java
private <K> void iterateKeys(List<K> keys) {
    for (K key : keys) {
        // do something generic
    }
}
```

This is useful if `someData` might have different key types in different contexts,
or if youâ€™re writing a utility function.

---

### âœ… 4. If you really donâ€™t care about type safety

You can technically do this (but not recommended unless itâ€™s temporary):

```java
private void iterateKeys(List<?> keys) {
    for (Object key : keys) {
        // do something
    }
}
```

`List<?>` means *a list of something*, but you canâ€™t modify it safely.

---

### âœ… TL;DR

| Situation                           | Method Signature                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| You know the key type (e.g. String) | `private void iterateKeys(List<String> keys)` |
| You want it generic                 | `private <K> void iterateKeys(List<K> keys)`  |
| You donâ€™t care about type safety    | `private void iterateKeys(List<?> keys)`      |

If you show me what `someData` looks like (its type declaration),
I can tell you exactly what the correct method signature should be.
