Good question 👍 The way you stop your program depends on how you launched it:

---

### ▶️ 1. **Normal foreground execution**

If you start like this:

```bash
java -jar target/your-app.jar > app.log 2>&1
```

* The program is tied to your terminal session.
* To stop it, just press **`Ctrl + C`** in that terminal.
* This sends a **SIGINT** (interrupt) to the process, same as when you stop in VS Code.

---

### ▶️ 2. **Background execution**

If you start like this:

```bash
java -jar target/your-app.jar > app.log 2>&1 &
```

* It’s now detached into the background.
* You’ll see a **job ID** like `[1] 12345` → here `12345` is the **process ID (PID)**.

Ways to stop it:

#### a) Bring it back to foreground, then stop

```bash
fg %1   # brings job 1 (the last background job) to the foreground
Ctrl + C
```

#### b) Kill by PID

If you didn’t bring it forward:

```bash
kill 12345
```

If the app ignores that, use force:

```bash
kill -9 12345
```

### ▶️ 3. If you forgot the PID

Find it with:

```bash
ps -ef | grep your-app.jar
```

Then kill as above.

---

### ⚡ Tip

If you often run your app in background, use **`nohup`** so it won’t die when you close the terminal:

```bash
nohup java -jar target/your-app.jar > app.log 2>&1 &
```

---

✅ So:

* Foreground: **Ctrl+C**
* Background: **fg + Ctrl+C** OR `kill PID`

Do you want me to also show you how to make your Spring Boot app shut down gracefully (so `Ctrl+C` or `kill` doesn’t just hard-kill it)?
