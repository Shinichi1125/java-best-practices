Short answer: Sonar’s not complaining about `Pattern.compile(...)` itself—it’s warning that the **regex string** you compile **might** be susceptible to catastrophic backtracking (ReDoS). It’s a *security hotspot*: you must **review** it, and either fix the pattern or explicitly mark the hotspot as reviewed with a justification.

Here’s how to handle it quickly and correctly.

---

## What to check in `PATTERN_NAME`

Open the actual regex and look for **backtracking-prone constructs**, especially in combination:

* **Nested quantifiers**: `(.*)+`, `(.+)+`, `(a*)+`, `(a+)+`, `(.+)*`, `((...)*|(...)+)+`
* **Ambiguous alternations** that overlap heavily: `(a|aa)+`, `(a|a?b)+`, `(.*a|.*b)`
* **Greedy `.*` inside groups** preceding other tokens: `^(.*)(\d+)$`, `^(.*a){10}$`
* **Backreferences** (`\1`, `\2`, …) on large inputs
* **Look-arounds** combined with the above (can amplify backtracking)
* **Unanchored patterns** that allow the engine to start matching at many positions (missing `^`/`$`) on long inputs

If you see any of these, assume risk unless you can prove otherwise.

## How to make it safe (recipes)

Pick whichever applies:

1. **Anchor your pattern**
   Use `^...$` when you want to match the entire string. This avoids scanning from many start positions.

2. **Replace `.*` with a *bounded* or *negated* class**

   * From: `^(.*),(\d+)$`
   * To: `^([^,\r\n]*+),(\\d+)$`
     (negated class prevents runaway; `*+` is **possessive** ⇒ no backtracking)

3. **Use possessive quantifiers or atomic groups** to cut backtracking

   * Greedy → possessive: `*`→`*+`, `+`→`++`, `?`→`?+`, `{m,n}`→`{m,n}+`
   * Or wrap in atomic group: `(?>...)`
     Example:
     From: `^(?:\w+)+$`
     To: `^(?>\w+)+$` **or** simply `^\w+$` (better)

4. **Avoid nested quantifiers entirely** by simplifying the regex

   * From: `^(a+)+$`
   * To: `^a+$`

5. **Bound input size** before matching
   If the input is user-supplied, enforce a length cap (e.g., reject > 10k chars) before regex.

6. **Linear-time engine (belt-and-suspenders)**
   If you must accept complex patterns, consider **RE2/J** (no backtracking, linear time):

   ```xml
   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.google.re2j</groupId>
     <artifactId>re2j</artifactId>
     <version>1.7</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

   ```java
   com.google.re2j.Pattern p = com.google.re2j.Pattern.compile(PATTERN_NAME);
   com.google.re2j.Matcher m = p.matcher(input);
   ```

   (Trade-offs: not 100% PCRE parity; most business patterns are fine.)

7. **Time-box matching (last resort)**
   Java’s `java.util.regex` has no native timeout. If you must keep a risky pattern, run matching in a separate thread and cancel after a small timeout. (This is operational mitigation, not a fix.)

---

## Quick test to reveal trouble

Try a “worst-case” input in a unit test. If your pattern looks like it could blow up, feed it a crafted string:

```java
// Example for patterns like ^(a+)+$
String evil = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaX"; // many 'a's then a mismatch
assertTimeoutPreemptively(Duration.ofMillis(50), () -> {
  Pattern p = Pattern.compile(PATTERN_NAME);
  Matcher m = p.matcher(evil);
  m.matches(); // if this hangs, you have ReDoS risk
});
```

If it times out or spikes CPU, fix the pattern per the recipes.

## What to do in SonarQube

* If you fix or harden the pattern: link the commit and mark the hotspot “Reviewed” with the rationale (e.g., “Anchored; replaced `.*` with `[^,]*+`; bounded input length to 4k.”).
* If the pattern is already safe: explain why (no nested quantifiers, anchored, bounded character classes, small max input) and mark as “Reviewed – safe”.

---

## TL;DR

Don’t ignore it blindly. Inspect `PATTERN_NAME`. If you see nested quantifiers, greedy `.*` in groups, or ambiguous alternations, **rewrite** with anchors, negated classes, and possessive/atomic constructs—or switch to RE2/J. Add an input length guard. Then mark the hotspot reviewed with your justification.
