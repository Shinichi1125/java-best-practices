I'm currently writing test code for Java mocking some objects. 

When running the tests with mvn clean package, I get the following error:
NullPointer Cannot invoke "String.equals(Object)" because the return value of "someDTO.getTypeCode" is null.

I mocked the DTO object like so:
SomeDTO someDTO = mock(SomeDTO.class);
when(someDTO.getTypeCode()).thenReturn("1");

And I think this line of code, which is executed in the actual runtime:
if(someDTO.getTypeCode().equals("1")) {
  // Handle the case scenario
}

is what the error is referring to, judging from the file name and the method name that are pointed out in the error message.

What am I doing wrong?
My Visual Studio Code prompts "anObject:1" inside the parenthesis of someDTO.getTypeCode().equals("1").
Does the error have something to do with a data type mismatch?
