I'm currently having a look at SonarQube's review for the code quality. 
It's informing me about a security hotspot: 
"Make sure the regex used here, which is vulnerable to polynomial runtime due to backgracking, cannot lead to denial of service."

I took a closer look at the line of code where it is pointed out, which looks like this:
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(PATTERN_NAME);

PATTERN_NAME is defined as a regular expression at the top of the file. 

I don't see what can be a problem here. 
Is there something to fix here?
Or is it okay to disregard this hotspot?
