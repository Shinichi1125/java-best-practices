When running the program via VS Code, you can stop the program by either clicking the square icon at the top 
or clicking somewhere in the console and executing the shortcut ctrl + c. 

When running the program via java -jar target/, especially when writing the output with >, how do you stop it
 (for normal program execution and running it in the background respectively)?
