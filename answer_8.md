Nice follow-up üëç

In Mockito, `any(LocalDate.class)` matches any non-null `LocalDate`.
If you also want to allow `null`, you can use `nullable(LocalDate.class)` instead.

So if your method looks like:

```java
int helperA(LocalDate start, LocalDate end) { ... }
```

Then the stubbing line would be:

```java
doReturn(10)
    .when(calculationService)
    .helperA(nullable(LocalDate.class), nullable(LocalDate.class));
```

---

### Variants:

* If you **don‚Äôt care** about `null` vs non-null (match both): `nullable()` is the way.
* If you **want to allow strictly null** as an argument, you can use `isNull(LocalDate.class)`.
* If you only want **non-null** dates: stick with `any(LocalDate.class)`.

---

‚úÖ Example full snippet:

```java
doReturn(42)
    .when(calculationService)
    .helperA(nullable(LocalDate.class), nullable(LocalDate.class));
```

Now, whether your test calls:

```java
calculationService.helperA(LocalDate.now(), null);
```

or

```java
calculationService.helperA(null, null);
```

‚Ä¶it will match the stub and return `42`.

üëâ Do you want me to also show you how to **verify** the call with nullables (e.g., `verify(calculationService).helperA(nullable(LocalDate.class), nullable(LocalDate.class));`)?
