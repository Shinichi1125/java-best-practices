You’ve nailed the root cause 👍 — VS Code’s integrated console *does* have a scrollback buffer limit, so once enough log output is printed, older lines get discarded. That’s why your early-stage logs seem to disappear.

### ✅ Solutions

#### 1. Redirect logs to a file (simple & reliable)

Yes, you can run the program from a terminal (e.g. Git Bash) and pipe the logs to a file:

```bash
java -jar target/your-app.jar > app.log 2>&1
```

* `>` → writes output to `app.log`.
* `2>&1` → redirects `stderr` into `stdout` (so you capture both).
* This way, you’ll always have the *full* log history.

Then you can use tools like `less`, `tail -f app.log`, or open the file in VS Code.

#### 2. Background execution

If you want to keep the program running and still use the terminal:

```bash
java -jar target/your-app.jar > app.log 2>&1 &
```

* `&` → runs in the background.
* You can still monitor logs with:

```bash
tail -f app.log
```

This lets you follow logs live without losing early ones.

#### 3. Configure logging framework

If your project uses **SLF4J + Logback / Log4j / JUL**, you can configure it to always log to both:

* console
* rolling file appender (e.g. `logs/app.log` with daily rotation).

That way, you never depend on console scroll limits.

---

#### 4. VS Code setting (short-term)

You can increase the scrollback buffer size in VS Code:
`File → Preferences → Settings → "terminal.integrated.scrollback"` → set a higher value (e.g. `100000`).

This won’t prevent log overflow for very long-running apps, but it helps.

### 🏆 Best practice

For real debugging or production-like testing, **don’t rely only on the IDE console**.
Always configure logs to go to a file (via logging config or shell redirection).
