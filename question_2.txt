I noticed that there are a few things that I didn't explain in my previous question.

1: Nested objects
There are ParentDTO, AnotherDTO, and SomeDTO.
Here is how they are related to each other. 

ParentDTO has AnotherDTO. 
AnotherDTO has a list of SomeDTOs. 

2: How the DTOs are passed when the method is called
In the test code, after mocking someDTO and setting mock values with when(), the code continues like this:

Result result = doTheWork(parentDTO);

assertEquals("1", result.getTheChildDTOProperty);

Is it highly likely that the error is because of this nested objects issue?
If so, how do I handle this?
