This is the method that I'm trying to test, which is in a controller file named "SomeController.java":

private final SomeService someService;

@AutoWired
public SomeController(SomeService someService) {
  this.someService = someService;
}

@PostMapping("/some-endpoint")
public ResponseEntity<SomeResponse> startTheProcess(@RequestBody SomeRequest someRequest) throws Exception {
  SomeDTO someDTO = handleProcess(someRequest.getRequestId());
  someRequest.setProcessId(someDTO.getProcessId());
  ProcessInstanceEvent event = someService.startProcess(someRequest);
  return new ResponseEntity<SomeResponse>(mapToSomeResponse(event, someDTO.getProcessId(), HttpStatus.OK));
}

Can you write SomeControllerTest.java with the following assumptions?

- Both handleProcess and mapToSomeResponse are located in the same file as SomeController.java.
- Both handleProcess and mapToSomeResponse are protected, not private. 
- The goal here is to write a unit test for startTheProcess, and handleProcess and mapToSomeResponse are to be mocked.
