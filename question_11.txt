I'm using VS Code for my current Java project. 
I can run the program by right-clicking and choosing the option "Run Java" in the file where I see 

public static void main(String[] args)

, and the IDE opens a console, where I can see the outputs of logger statements that I placed in the codebase. 

At this moment, I want to observe what's going on at an early stage of the program execution. 
I tried to see the logs, but the logs that I wanted to see were "washed away" because the processes kept flowing down in the console. 
It seems that the console opened in VS Code has an upper limit on how far I can scroll up, 
and because of this limit I can't scroll back to the point where I can see the early log statements. 

What would be the solution for this?
Should I run the program via a terminal (in my case Git Bash on Windows) after compiling it by mvn clean package, 
and write it to an external file using ">" like this 

> PATH_TO_THE_FILE_WHERE_I_WANT_ALL_THE_LOGGERS

?

If so, should I run the program in background?
