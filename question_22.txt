Let's say that there is a large method that spans across dozens of lines, and it has a big for loop:

List keys = new ArrayList(someData.keySet());
for(Object key: keys) {
  ......
}

I want to abstract away this for loop as a method named iterateKeys and call it like this:
List keys = new ArrayList(someData.keySet());
iterateKeys(keys);

However, I'm not fully sure what data type to be used when I define the method:

private void iterateKeys(/*WhatDataType?*/ keys) {

}
